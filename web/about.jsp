                                    <p>The most common contemporary understanding of theme is an idea or point that is
                                        central to a story, which can often be summed in a single word (for example, love,
                                        death, betrayal). Typical examples of themes of this type are conflict between the
                                        individual and society; coming of age; humans in conflict with technology;
                                        nostalgia; and the dangers of unchecked ambition.[example needed] A theme may be
                                        exemplified by the actions, utterances, or thoughts of a character in a novel. An
                                        example of this would be the thematic idea of loneliness in John Steinbeck's Of Mice
                                        and Men, wherein many of the characters seem to be lonely. It may differ from the
                                        thesis the text's or author's implied worldview.</p>

                                    <p>A story may have several themes. Themes often explore historically common or
                                        cross-culturally recognizable ideas, such as ethical questions, and are usually
                                        implied rather than stated explicitly. An example of this would be whether one
                                        should live a seemingly better life, at the price of giving up parts of one's
                                        humanity, which is a theme in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Along with plot,
                                        character, setting, and style, theme is considered one of the components of fiction.

                                    <p>Leitwortstil, which means "leading word style" in German, is the repetition of a
                                        wording, often with a theme, in a narrative to make sure it catches the reader's
                                        attention. An example of a leitwortstil is the recurring phrase, "So it goes", in
                                        Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse-Five. Its seeming message is that the world is
                                        deterministic: that things only could have happened in one way, and that the future
                                        already is predetermined. But given the anti-war tone of the story, the message
                                        perhaps is on the contrary, that things could have been different. Its use in
                                        Scheherazade's Arabian Nights demonstrates how the technique can result to the
                                        unification of the constituent members of story cycles.</p>


                                    <p>In the Bible, various forms of the verb "to see" also recur and underscore the idea
                                        of Abraham as a seer. There is also the repeated use of the root kbd in Samuel I, to
                                        indicate "weightiness, honor, glory".</p>

                                    <p>Thematic patterning means the insertion of a recurring motif in a narrative. For
                                        example, various scenes in John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men are about loneliness.
                                        Thematic patterning is evident in One Thousand and One Nights an example being the
                                        story of "The City of Brass". According to David Pinault, the overarching theme of
                                        that tale, in which a group of travelers roam the desert in search of ancient brass
                                        artifacts, is that "riches and pomp tempt one away from God".</p>


                                    <p>The narrative is interrupted several times by stories within the story. These include
                                        a tale recorded in an inscription found in the palace of Kush ibh Shaddad; a story
                                        told by a prisoner about Solomon; and an episode involving Queen Tadmur's corpse.
                                        According to Pinault, "each of these minor narratives introduces a character who
                                        confesses that he once proudly enjoyed worldly prosperity: subsequently, we learn,
                                        the given character has been brought low by God ... These minor tales ultimately
                                        reinforce the theme of the major narrative".</p>
